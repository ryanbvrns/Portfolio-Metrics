# Portfolio-Metrics
# This project I put together pulls historical data from Yahoo finance and stores it in excel files to
be used by the other python files. Use the "Yahoo Finance Data" file to download the historical data by
following the prompts. Once you have downloaded the data it can be used in any other file.

"Analysis, 3" at the time of sending this code is not working. I plan to include price plots, return distributions, QQ plots, ACF, and a few other statistical measurements.
