# This project I put together pulls historical data from Yahoo finance and stores it in excel files to
# be used by the other python files. Use the "Yahoo Finance Data" file to download the historical data by
# following the prompts. Once you have downloaded the data it can be used in any other file.

# "Analysis, 3" at the time of sending this code is not working. I plan to include price plots, return distributions,
# QQ plots, ACF, and a few other statistical measurements.
